                    <p>Hi, my name is LillyAna Harris; I am a full-time student at Arizona Christian University, where I am studying computer science and theology. I was born and raised in various areas of Arizona, including Flagstaff, Glendale, and Scottsdale. As the fourth oldest of ten children, I have learned to be a highly organized and logical leader. These skills have helped me succeed in my athletic, spiritual, and academic life. A motto I live by is "learn to be comfortable being uncomfortable." This motto has allowed me to view difficult times/tasks with a growth mindset. Forcing me to see the beauty in hard things and see how difficult times are merely phases of learning and becoming better.</p>

                    <h4>CSC II: Python I</h4>
                    <p>This course provided a very thorough introduction to Python programming. I learned the fundamental ideas and methods I need to write programs and do simple data analysis in the course. By the time the course was over, I was fully ready to continue my studies in computer science and access more difficult programming courses.</p>

                    <h4>CSC III: Python II</h4>
                    <p>I learned how to use my Python expertise in this course to handle the internet as a data source. Additionally, it gave me a solid foundation in both database architecture and structured query language (SQL). In general, the training assisted me in honing my coding abilities and teaching me how to build a variety of applications.</p>

                    <h4>CSC IV: Web Development</h4>
                    <p>This course provided a thorough introduction to the planning, production, distribution, and upkeep of standards-based, useful material on the internet. The class also taught the underlying markup languages, as well as how to master the aesthetics of web design. The class taught me how to construct and manage high-quality websites, how to critically evaluate web design quality and the significance of accessibility and web design standards. The class taught me to construct cutting-edge websites using JavaScript, CSS3, and HTML5. This personal portfolio website that you are currently scrolling through is a result of this class!</p>

                <div class="ExperienceInfo1">
                    <h4>Logical</h4>
                    <p>I am an extremely logical thinker! My capacity for logical thought has been extremely valuable and crucial in my life so far. It has assisted me in making crucial decisions, finding solutions to issues, coming up with original ideas, and setting goals. This skill is something that I know will set me apart from my peers.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="ExperienceInfo2">
                    <h4>Attention to Detail</h4>
                    <p>Paying close attention to detail is a skill that I have not had to work for, as it was something that came very naturally to me. I have the ability to complete a task while demonstrating a thorough concern for all the areas involved, no matter how small they may be. My ability to pay attention to detail is something that helps me be both efficient and productive. This skill allows me to produce error-free accurate work, which the people around me often appreciate.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="ExperienceInfo3">
                    <h4>Work in Childcare</h4>
                    <p>Being the fourth oldest of ten children has automatically ushered me into the caretaking position of being a "babysitter." And after many years of taking care of my younger siblings, I decided to begin working as a childcare provider. It has now been two years that I have worked for Busy Bees Babysitting Company, where I am an independent contractor. Having been a babysitter and childcare provider for many years, I can confidently say I have learned a great deal. First, I have learned to communicate effectively so that it is clear and concise. Second, working with kids has taught me to be creative and think outside of the box using a more childlike imagination. And third, I have learned the art of enthusiasm and how being and acting excited (even when I do not feel that way) can alter the emotions and feelings of those around me to feel excited as well. These three things have helped me in many other areas of my life!</p>

                <div class="ExperienceInfo4">
                    <h4>Reffing</h4>
                    <p>Working as a soccer referee for four years has taught me patience, the capacity to maintain composure under pressure, and the ability to operate effectively under pressure. It has also taught me how to receive and effectively apply criticism. Working as a ref trained me to be authoritative and to do everything thoroughly and carefully in a collaborative setting.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="ExperienceInfo5">
                    <h4>Full-time Student</h4>
                    <p>Being a full-time student has taught me to manage my time, plan ahead, stay organized, and learn from my mistakes. Managing my time correctly ensures I always meet deadlines and avoid feeling stressed. Planning ahead has not only helped me keep peace of mind but also make informed decisions about my schedule. Staying organized using a digital agenda helps me stay on top of my to-do, ensuring I never forget anything. Finally, learning to acknowledge the mistakes that I make and then growing from them has turned me into a more humble person.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="ExperienceInfo6">
                    <h4>Hard working</h4>
                    <p>As a dedicated full-time student, athlete, and employee, I exemplify what it means to be a hard worker. In my academic life, I work hard to keep a 4.0 GPA. In my athletics, I train to accomplish outstanding feats (i.e., running a marathon.) And as an employee for both AZreferee Association and Busy Bee Babysitting Company, I work hard to ensure my employers and clients are satisfied with my work. Being someone who goes above and beyond is something I value and strive for in all aspects of my life!</p>
